# Aexis Task Manager - Development Plan

## Introduction

We are building a sophisticated task and event management system using Next.js 15 (App Router) with TypeScript and Supabase as our backend. The application will provide an intuitive timeline-based interface for managing tasks and events across different organizational contexts (Projects, Clients) with temporal and priority-based organization.

Key Features:

- Horizontal column "timeline" view organized by weeks
- Day-based rows grouped in each Week-based column
- Column sorting by Project, Client, Date, and Priority
- Real-time updates using Supabase
- Modern authentication flow
- Responsive and intuitive UI

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Authentication

1. Initialize Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and App Router

   - Use `create-next-app` with Supabase template
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set up TypeScript configuration

2. Implement Authentication (Supabase Auth)
   - Set up auth providers
   - Create login/signup flows
   - Implement protected routes
   - Add session management
   - Configure auth middleware

### Phase 2: Database Schema and Types

1. Design and implement Supabase database schema

   ```sql
   - Users table (handled by Supabase Auth)
   - Projects table
   - Clients table
   - Tasks table
   - Events table
   - Tags/Categories table
   ```

2. Generate and configure TypeScript types
   - Set up type generation pipeline
   - Create custom type utilities
   - Implement database interface types

### Phase 3: Core Features Implementation

1. Timeline View Components

   - Create base layout structure
   - Implement week-based navigation
   - Build daily column components
   - Add drag-and-drop functionality

2. Task/Event Management

   - Create/Edit/Delete operations
   - Status management
   - Priority handling
   - Date/time management
   - Project/Client association

3. Data Fetching Layer
   - Implement Supabase queries
   - Set up real-time subscriptions
   - Create data hooks and utilities
   - Optimize for performance

### Phase 4: UI/UX Development

1. Timeline Interface

   - Responsive design implementation
   - Accessibility features
   - Interactive elements
   - Loading states and animations

2. Task/Event Cards
   - Card component design
   - Status indicators
   - Priority visualization
   - Interactive features

### Phase 5: Advanced Features

1. Filtering and Search

   - Implementation of filter logic
   - Search functionality
   - Advanced sorting options

2. Real-time Collaboration

   - Real-time updates
   - Conflict resolution
   - Presence indicators

3. Data Export/Import
   - CSV export functionality
   - Import utilities
   - Data backup features

### Phase 6: Testing and Deployment

1. Testing Implementation

   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - E2E tests
   - Performance testing

2. Deployment
   - Production environment setup
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Performance optimization
